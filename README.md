An experimental extension for [Specs](https://github.com/slide-rs/specs).
This adds component storages that are not indexed by `Entity`, but by custom ids that
are entirely managed by the user.

This can be useful for tile maps where you want each tile to have certain components. Managing
the ids manually will give you a huge performance boost here.

## Usage

Please see [the basic example](examples/basic.rs).

### Required Rust version

`1.29 stable`

## Features

* `Storage` with custom ids
* `get`, `get_mut` and `Join`
* `WorldExt` for registering these storages
